# Pyn: A Comprehensive Password Security Toolkit

## üîê Overview

Pyn is a Python-based web application designed to enhance password security through advanced analysis and generation capabilities. It allows users to create, evaluate, and strengthen their passwords with detailed insights and recommendations. This tool is inspired by the [Cygnius Password Test](https://apps.cygnius.net/passtest/).

## üöÄ Key Features

### üîé Password Analysis
- Comprehensive strength evaluation
- Entropy calculation
- Crack time estimation
- Complexity assessment
- Pwned password detection

### üîß Password Generation
- Customizable password creation
- Secure random generation
- Multiple character set options
- Configurable length and complexity
